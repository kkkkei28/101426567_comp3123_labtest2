# Getting Started with Create React App

## Weather App
### Description
This Weather App is a simple, user-friendly ReactJS application that allows users to view real-time weather conditions for any city. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key weather information such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, sunrise, and sunset times. The app also provides a 5-day forecast with interactive UI elements.

This project was completed as part of the COMP3123 Lab Test 2 at George Brown College.
